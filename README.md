## Overview

DCQA is a large-scale document-level chart question answering dataset that emphasizes logical and common-sense reasoning. In comparison to previous chart question answering datasets, this dataset innovatively integrates charts into the context of documents, making it more realistic for chart question answering requirements. Additionally, the questions in the DCQA dataset necessitate a certain level of common-sense for logical reasoning. The dataset comprises 50,010 generated documents containing charts and 699,051 questions that that demand a high degree of reasoning ability and common-sense understanding.  It has been partitioned into training, validation, and test sets with a ratio of 8:1:1.
